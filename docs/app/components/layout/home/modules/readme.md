# React Toolbox Components

React Toolbox is a library of React Components based on Google's Material Design Guidelines. The main purpose of the documentation is to explore each of the components and to learn how to use them. To make the best possible experience and to experiment with the components properties and methods, we've created a playground to try components live.

On the top right side of the screen you will see a rounded button with a code icon. It opens a the playground with a small in-browser editor and an area to render what you type in real time. Inside the documentation of each component you will see one or multiple example code boxes. Each of them can include a button to open the given code in the playground.

Enjoy and remember that [feedback](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/issues) is really appreciated.
