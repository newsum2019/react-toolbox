# Drawer

The [navigation drawer](https://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) slides in from the left. It is a common pattern found in Google apps and follows the keylines and metrics for lists.

<!-- example -->
```jsx
import Drawer from 'react-toolbox/lib/drawer';

class DrawerTest extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    this.refs.drawer.show();
  };

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Button kind='raised' accent label='Show Drawer' onClick={this.handleClick} />
        <Drawer ref='drawer' hideable>
          <h5>This is your Drawer.</h5>
          <p>You can embed any content you want, for example a Menu.</p>
        </Drawer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
